# Frontend Asset Guidelines

*Note:*
This is a skeleton assets project with Grunt as a task runner. Not all tasks will be needed on every project so remove ones that are not needed or used.

## First time set up
Because of the amount of tasks this can sometimes be a bit tricky to set up. If you are having difficult it's possible you have wrong versions of key components.

Running `npm install --production` will only install core plugins.

`npm install` includes additional modules you may not need, such as KSS, Grunticon and Validation tasks.

Open up the terminal and cd to the directory you want to place the project. Then run the following command

    git clone git@gitlab.rippleffect.com:front-end/php-skeleton.git

in the terminal, direct to the Grunt folder (/grunt/) and run `npm install`

Ensure that the version of Node.js is v.0.12.7 (minimum requirements)

Check current version of Node.js - `nodejs --version`

Update to current Version of Node.js -

    sudo npm cache clean -f
    sudo npm install -g n
    sudo n stable

If encountering error when running npm install  direct to the root folder and run the following commandâ€¦

    sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local

Update the required gems using `sudo gem update --system`

You may have to also install the SCSS Lint gem - `sudo gem install scss-lint`

You should be good to go, run grunt

## Global installs
Grunt, Sass, Bower and Bourbon need to be installed on a global basis

## Bower installation
Bower is used for the installation of modules. The bower_component's folder is store in the web directory. Do not commit the bower_components folder.
A bower.json file will installed basic packages that are used on the site. More packages can be added on a per project basis.
Bower will need to be installed for the project when pulling down from git.

## Grunt
Grunt is used for automated tasks. It is used for compilation, testing, Styleguide generation and validation. The default task does not have a watch command so that it can be run with a Continuous Integration environment. Grunt is installed in the web directory so that it's easy to get to for running tasks and so that you can use the same gruntfile for multiple themes if needed.

## Concatenation and Minification
Files should be concatenated and minified for production. If the CMS has the ability to do this then use that functionality. If not minification and concatenation tasks can be added to Grunt.

## SCSS linting
SCSS linting is used with a CCF1 standard - http://github.com/adamhughes86/CCF1

## Vendor Prefixes
Autoprefixer is used as a grunt task to generate vendor prefixes. Don't use Bourbon or a mixin for prefixing.

## SVG's
SVG's are preferred over iconfonts and sprites. Grunticon is used so that fallbacks are created. Grunticon has the ability to embed SVG's in the document but a Javascript function needs to be added to the head of the file. To animate and svg it needs to be embedded in the document. This can be done by adding a `span` with the `.icon-[name]` class and adding `data-grunticon-embed` as an attribute to the span. There is the ability to use the SVG as a pseudo element but they can not be animated this way.

## Styleguide generation
A styleguide is generated in the assets folder `assets/styleguide` and can be accessed through a server. This is created with KSS. Comments must adhere to a KSS format otherwise the handlebars generation will fail. A custom KSS theme has been added into the Grunt folder. New modules can have a HTML version added into a KSS comment to provide clarity. These must be manually updated.

## Regression Testing with PhantomCSS
The styleguide can be used to do Regression Testing. Regression tests are handled with PhantomCSS and run on their own Grunt task `grunt regression`.

## Validation
There is a grunt task for validating your local site. You will need to have a local version of the w3c validator installed. You update the gruntfile with the pages you want to test against. This can be styleguide pages or site pages.
